FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT:
1) make game window blink when new turn starts, maybe some sound byte
2) make lobby chatbox take in chat from players
3) allow race selection per player, including host
4) if you are out of units and you hit plus, it takes from another lane that is greater than 0
5) 30 seconds of no end turn, display some message to say "take your turn" and then 15 seconds layer auto do their turn with whatever assignignment theyhave

6) consider case where someone joins while a game is in motion
7) stash units if you dont expend some
8) round counter: real player wins after x many round wins


special abilities:
-get two more units next round (barbarians)
-all rolls are 7 next round (knights)
-steal 1d3 hp from a lane (leech lich)
-reflect all damage frm a lane (snails)



NICE TO HAVES (not necessary for MVP):
--maybe add currency between certain lines that incentivizes players to attack each other
---and in between rounds players can spend currency for consumable items - all players can see all consummables
